# odin-recipes
This is my first html odin project .
This project is a basic html project designed to give you a taste of html
and how the sites are structured through html at a very basic level.

At the end of this project I will be aware with the following skills:
-->Basic structuring of a html page
-->Linking htmnl pages
-->using certain Html tags (h1,img,a,....)
